# MORRA GAME
This is the umoja 3 bounty hack project for team 55 which is a traditional game called MORRA.

The logic behind this game is pretty simple, two players have the ability to pick a number between 0 and 5, each player then makes a guess of the sum of his opponents number and his number, whoever gets the right guess gets his portion of the pot aka the wager. This dapp has a similar concept to the rock paper scissors dapp but a completely different logic and implementation.
